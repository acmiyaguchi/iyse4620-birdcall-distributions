\begin{abstract}

We utilize geospatial features of bird call metadata from the BirdCLEF 2022 competition to derive a distribution map for a subset of species in California and the Western United States.
We build several Bayesian models incorporating species frequency information and remote sensing data from USGS and NASA in a regular lattice built from area-of-interest (AOI) geometries. 
We use hierarchical modeling to incorporate information across a subset of species and a conditional autoregressive (CAR) distribution for spatial random effects and generate several species distribution maps.
All code and data are available on request and may be available publicly on GitHub/GCP, pending permission from course instructors.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

We are interested in whether we can produce and analyze species distribution maps using Bayesian methods.

The BirdCLEF Challenge is a yearly competition held as part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum.
The purpose of the challenge is to classify bird call segments and species from soundscapes captured from audio recording devices deployed in the fields.
The competition hosts provide a training dataset derived from xeno-canto, a crowd-sourced platform for sharing user-generated recordings of bird calls worldwide.

\section{Dataset}
\subsection{BirdCLEF 2022 Training Metadata}

The BirdCLEF 2022 competition provides over 14,800 recordings from 152 species \cite{kahl2022overview}.
We are interested in the spatial features from the recording metadata, which are the latitude and longitude of the recording.
The competition draws recordings from the xeno-canto library, but it does not reflect the entirety of the library.
Each species is capped at 500 recordings in the dataset, with the frequency of recordings generally correlated with their rarity in nature and population density, among other factors.

\subsection{Google Earth Engine}

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for processing geospatial data \cite{gorelick_google_2017}.
We use remote sensing data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to obtain elevation, temperature, land cover classification, and population density data from various sources hosted on Earth Engine.

The NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission dataset (\texttt{USGS/SRTMGL1\_003}) \cite{nasa_srtmg} provides elevation data.
The MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity dataset (\texttt{MODIS/006/MOD11A1}) \cite{wan_zhengming_mod11a1_2015} provides temperature data.
The MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type dataset (\texttt{MODIS/006/MCD12Q1}) \cite{friedl_mark_mcd12q1_2019} provides land cover classification statistics.
The Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 dataset (\texttt{CIESIN/GPWv411/GPW\_Population\_Density}) \cite{gpwv4} provides population density data.

We generate a regular lattice of polygons from area-of-interest (AOI) geometries that derive a dataset for a region at a fraction of a degree resolution.
We chose California and the Western United States as our AOI due to familiarity with the region and the diversity of geography and climate.
The dataset is generated over each polygon in the lattice, computing an aggregate statistic from each data source.

\section{Data and Analysis}

\subsection{Conditional Autoregressive Distribution}

The following equation gives the likelihood of a conditional autoregression (CAR) distribution:

\begin{equation}
f(x|W, \alpha, \tau) =
    \frac{|T|^{1/2}}{(2\pi)^{k/2}}
    \exp \left\{
        -\frac{1}{2} (x - \mu)^\prime T^{-1} (x - \mu)
    \right\}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    T &= (\tau D (I-\alpha W))^{-1} \\
    D &= diag(\sum_{i} W_{ij})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


The CAR distribution is a particular form of the multivariate normal with a covariance matrix that captures the adjacency structure of the neighborhood graph. 
PyMC provides this distribution out-of-the-box, which we utilize for spatial random effects \cite{salvatier_probabilistic_2016}.

\subsection{Stochastic Search Variable Selection}

There are a total of 27 features that are available for modeling.
Many of these features, such as land cover classification, may have a significant degree of skewness affecting the fitted model.
We use a stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) to inform our choice of feature transformation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{report/figures/svss_model.png}
\end{figure}

We fit a Poisson GLM to the Western US dataset where $\beta$ terms are a deterministic function $\delta$ representing the binary likelihood that the model includes a feature and $\alpha$ representing the strength of the covariate in the regression.
In our first model, we include all raw (or non-transformed) features and concatenate them with the log-scaled population density features and land cover classification.
We do not scale elevation and temperature because these features are not heavy-tailed.

We observe in figure \ref{fig:svss_log_vs_nonlog} that mean values of $\delta$ are more prominent and, therefore, more likely to be included in a model.
We count the instances of each possible model and find the most likely models supported by the data.
In table \ref{table:svss_log_vs_nonlog_models}, we find that the SSVS procedure favors log-scaled land cover classification features over the non-transformed features, corroborating the comparison of $\delta$ means in figure \ref{fig:svss_log_vs_nonlog}.

\subsection{Model Selection}
\label{model_selection}

We try out a variety of Poisson Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for developing our distribution map.
These models have three main components: an intercept term, a feature term, and a random spatial effects term.
We use hierarchical and multi-level modeling techniques to pool and vary information across observations, species, and geographical grid indices.

TODO: write out three models

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{report/figures/full_model.png}
\caption{Varying intercept, varying covariate, CAR model}
\end{figure}

We compare our models using the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) on a deviance scale in table \ref{table:waic_comparison}.
We choose the model with the lowest deviance to impute empty cells.
According to the ranking, the best model is the varying intercept, slope, and CAR model.

\subsection{Posterior Predictive Distribution Maps}

We fit our best model to the data and impute all empty cells in the Western US (2-degree resolution) dataset.
We prepare the dataset by grouping birdcall recording locations into their bounding cells and primary species labels.
To avoid excess computation and sparsity, we choose a subset of bird species and set a default category of "other".

We model using two variations of the prepared dataset.
In figure \ref{fig:map_4}, we choose the top 3 species and impute the rest of the missing cells.
We note that this results in a total of $211/384$ or 55\% of entries that need to be imputed.
Sampling from the posterior takes 7 minutes and 40 seconds with 16 cores for 56000 samples.
The second model uses the top 15 species to generate the dataset, which has greater sparsity with $1178/1536$ or 77\% of entries that need to be imputed.
With greater sparsity comes higher computational costs, with the larger dataset and model taking 37 minutes and 44 seconds to sample.
We also fit models where we impute missing values with 0 ahead of time.
In this case, the model takes 4 minutes and 50 seconds and 8 minutes and 2 seconds, respectively.

\end{figure}

In our three species example in figure \ref{fig:map_4}, we observe the effects of our choice of hierarchical modeling.
We note the high-frequency cells (yellow) in the northern and southernmost points of the birdcall recording plot.
The prediction plot shows that the model shares information across species.
The likeliest source of this comes from the CAR distribution, which is instantiated once across all species.
Instead of other information, the random effect of that particular geographical cell is more prominent.

We make a few species-specific observations in the top 15 species in figure \ref{fig:map_16}.
First, we take a look at Gambel's Quail (gamqua) and the California Quail (calqua), which have distinctive geographical distributions localized to the US Southwest and California, respectively, as per distribution maps on eBird \cite{ebird_gamqua} \cite{ebird_calqua}.
The raw recording frequencies generally fall within this distribution.

In our initial implementation, where we imputed all missing values as missing completely at random (MCAR), we note that the posterior predictive for these two quail species does not accurately reflect the actual distribution of birdcall recording frequencies.
Instead of treating missing observations as areas with a low likelihood of predictive values, it instead tries to impute them using a reasonable value from the posterior of observed data.
The bottom of \ref{fig:map_16} includes the final model where we set missing values to 0.
The model reasonably captures these quail species' spatial frequency to a reasonable degree.
However, we note a strong bias toward observations across all species.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{report/figures/trace_plot_phi.png}
\caption{Trace plot of slopes $\beta$ and spatial random effects $\phi$.}
\label{fig:trace_plot}
\end{figure}

When we look at the distribution of our values of $\phi$ in figure \ref{fig:trace_plot}, we see many values are more significant than 1.
Because the model shares spatial random effects across species, we end up with predictive values that extend further than what the actual natural distribution might be.
However, we are limited in PyMC because we cannot create a multi-dimensional CAR variable with one variable per species.
If we could model random geospatial effects on a per-species basis using a shared hyper-prior on alpha, our models may fit our data better.


\section{Conclusion}

We made design choices during this analysis, including data collection resolution (i.e., how large are grid cells for Google Earth Engine), dealing with missing observations, and modeling structure.
We found that hierarchical models, while powerful, can introduce complicating factors that reduce the interpretability of the final species distribution map.
We also have to remember the distributional semantics of the birdcall recording metadata.
The set of people who use and upload to xeno-canto are more likely to visit and record birds in easily accessible regions of the world.
In addition, the set of recordings included in the BirdCLEF competition is a much smaller subset than what is available from the source site.

We want to explore the effect of the underlying dataset resolution on modeling and choose a more extensive geography that spans several continents.
We also want to explore using hexagonal lattices, which we can implement with trivial modifications.
Finally, it would be interesting to use data directly from xeno-canto instead of using the BirdCLEF competition training subset.
The source dataset would contain far more data points and might make up for structural choices that we impose on our model.

On the modeling side, it would be interesting to determine how to create an instance of a CAR distribution per species.
This limitation causes unwanted shrinkage and forces us to build a model per species without access to multi-level modeling techniques.
Further research is needed to find multivariate distributions that accept a kernel, allowing for a more nuanced smoothness parameter across a neighborhood of cells.
For example, instead of a binary adjacency matrix, we might define a weighted adjacency matrix such that influence drops at an exponential rate up to a Manhattan distance of 3 from the originating cell.

Through this project, we can build a species distribution map of geospatial metadata attached to birdcall recordings using Bayesian modeling methodologies.
Using Google Earth Engine, we can incorporate information from various public sources by discretizing our data into regular lattices.
Though there are computational and modeling choices that make geospatial modeling challenging, it is a reasonable way to generate species distribution maps.
