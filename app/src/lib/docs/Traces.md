One key component of Bayesian analysis is the ability to quantify uncertainty in the model predictions.
We take advantage of this uncertainty to classify whether a particular parameter in the model is significant.
We say that a parameter in the model is significant if it's credible interval does not include zero (i.e. an analogy to rejecting the null hypothesis in a frequentist analysis).
