We split each region into a grid and summarize birdcall recording observations into each grid cell.
These discrete cells help when fitting a Bayesian model to the data, and also allow us to incorporate external geographical information derived from Google Earth Engine.
The posterior predictive is the estimated point prediction for the number of observations in each grid cell, derived from the posterior distribution of the model parameters.
